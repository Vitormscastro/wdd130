        <img src="images/profile.JPG" alt="Hello, my name is Vitor Castro" width="300">
        <p>Hey! I am Vitor and I'm from Brazil. I am pursuing a bachelors degree in software development. I am the middle child of 3 siblings and some things I like to do are play volleyball and videogames.</p>
        <p>I've always been a member of the Church and it is one of the most important parts of my life! I love to live the gospel, because it is a gospel of change and growth! I know it will help me throughout this course.</p>
        <p>One of my goals learning software development and programming languages is to get into game development. It is a more specific niche of development, but it is the one I take most interest in!</p>
        <p>My favorite temples are:</p>

        <p>Brazil, my home, is a beautiful and diverse country. It is located in South America and has around 215 million people. We speak portuguese and have roots from many european countries.</p>
